- Update documentation.

Version 1.1.1 - 2009-09-30

  that was bound to the "Sync selections". Now it is always possible to keep
  the selections in the history (as it was the case in older version).
- Note about the regex nature in the actions dialog being always anchored.

Version 1.1.0 - 2009-09-03

- Settings dialog is an external application xfce4-clipman-settings.  Optional
  support for libunique to make the settings dialog unique.
- Switched to GIO for file monitoring support over the actions XML file.
  Minimum version requirement for glib bumped to 2.16.
- The bundle "standalone app/panel plugin" is splitted in two binaries.

  launched the autostart file is automatically set to true, and when it is

  and replicates them to the clipboard before it is going empty.
- Added groups into ClipmanActions identified by integers where -1 represents
  all the groups. This makes it possible to retrieve only a set of actions. The
  Clipman settings dialog has a new checkbox to retrieve actions only on manual
